This application is a showcase of high-quality images from Unsplash, displayed as beautiful and classic cards with their details such as owner name, date, and owner's Instagram. It also features a custom infinite scroll without using without npm plugin, and a search function to find images by keywords. The data flow is managed by the Redux toolkit to provide an impressive UI experience.

## IMPORTANT: API Limit ( 50 per hour) 

Here are some of the major features and their benefits: 

1. Using Unsplash (Photo, search) APIs to render images or search by query.
2. Using Tailwind for responsive design and elegant styling.
3. Using Redux-toolkit for data management such as search, render, and infinite scrolling.
4. Creating a custom infinite scroll without any npm plugin for smooth loading and performance.
5. Enhancing user feedback with appropriate messages and animations.


PS: Feel free to clone the repository and run npm install to start your dev server.

NOTE: I would appreciate any kind of feedback from you for my further improvement.

Thank you!
